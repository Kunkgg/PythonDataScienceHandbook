=== Understanding Data Types in Python

Python is a dynamic typing language.
Languages like C or Java are statically-typed.
The main difference:

* In C, data types of each variable are explicitly declared.
+
[source, c]
----
/* C code */
int result = 0;
for(int i=0; i<100; i++){
    result += i;
}
----
* In Python, types are dynamic inferred.
+
[source, python]
----
# Python code
result = 0
for i in range(100):
    result += i
----
* In Python, we can switch the data types of each variable dynamically. +
In C, the data types are fixed after declaring each variable.
If you try to switch data types of a variable after declaring in C,
it would lead (depending on complier settings) to a compliantion error or other
unintented results.

# Python code
x = 4
x = "four"

/* C code */
int x = 4;
x = "four";  // FAILS
